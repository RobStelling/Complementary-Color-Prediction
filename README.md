The inner circle displays the original RGB colors, the middle circle displays the computed complementary colors and the outer circle displays the approximated colors by the neural network.

The text in the middle of circle tells how many steps where necessary to reach the current stage, the value of the cost function and the time, in minutes, that it took for the network to reach the current stage.
