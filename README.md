Example of a run when the convergence criteria was met.

The inner circle displays the original RGB colors, the middle circle displays the corresponding complementary colors and the outer circle displays the predicted colors by the neural network.

The text in the middle of circle tells how many steps where necessary to reach the current stage, the value of the cost function and the time, in minutes, that it took for the network to reach the current stage.
